I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Caltech in Computer Science and Information and Data Sciences.  I am a member of [Dr. Anima Anandkumar's](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) group. I am interested generally interested in solving problems in machine learning related to generalization from limited data including problems in ML safety such as fairness and robustness as well as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.
