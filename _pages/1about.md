I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Caltech in Computer Science and Information and Data Sciences.  I am a member of [Dr. Anima Anandkumar's](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) group. My research interests are centered around solving problems in machine learning which arise from training with limited data including generalization, fairness, robustness, domain adaptation, and few-shot learning.
