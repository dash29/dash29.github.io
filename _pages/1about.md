I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Caltech in Computer Science and Information and Data Sciences.  I am a member of [Dr. Anima Anandkumar's](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) group. I am interested in solving problems in machine learning related to generalization from limited data including problems in ML safety such as fairness and robustness as well as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.
